	diffstat 1.31

	add -u, -k options to override diffstat's normal sorting (-u) and
	merging (-k) of identical filenames.  (-u requested by H Peter Anvin
	<hpa@zytor.com>).

09-Aug-2002
	diffstat 1.30

	allow either '/' or '-' as delimiters in dates, to accommodate gendiff
	(report by Rik van Riel <riel@conectiva.com.br>).  This corresponds to
	the time format used in diffutils 2.8 whose changelog states that this
	is ISO 8601 (though online references differ).

10-Oct-2001
	diffstat 1.29

	add bzip2 (.bz2) suffix as suggested by Gregory T Norris
	<haphazard@socket.net> in Debian bug report #82969).

	add check for diff from RCS archive where the "diff" lines do not
	reference a filename.

29-Mar-2000
	diffstat 1.28

	Add -c option (to prefix output with '#' comment), eliminating a step
	in my script that combines diffstat output with a patch.  This is a
	workaround for OSF1's broken sed utility.

	Check for compressed file suffixes .Z and .gz, read uncompressed data
	via pipe (Debian wishlist item #53975 by ch@lathspell.westend.com).

	Simplified makefile based on comments by M Sweger
	<mikesw@whiterose.net>

	Adapted changes from Troy Engel <tengel@sonic.net> as "-f" option.

27-May-1998
	diffstat 1.27

	Debian diff's don't show dates on the lines where we expect to see
	filenames.

Patch 5 (16-Jan-1998)
	diffstat 1.26

	Change copyright terms.

 	Accommodate patches w/o tabs in header lines (e.g., from cut/paste).
	Still prefer the tabs because otherwise we cannot have spaces in
	filenames.

 	Strip suffixes such as ".orig", to avoid confusing output.

Patch 4 (16-Mar-1996)
	diffstat 1.24

	Corrected state-transition after "Binary".

	Added testing subdirectory

	Added -p option.

	Handle differences from /tmp (e.g., for X11R5 patches).

Patch 3 (06-May-1995)

	Repost whole program to comp.sources.misc (1.17)

	Mods to scaling: limit to 1:1 if only a few changes were made; added
	logic to accumulate error across +/-/!  calls.

	added logic to recognize 'rcsdiff -u' output.

Patch 2 (26-Dec-1994)

	Strip common pathname prefix (1.15)

Patch 1 (13-Nov-1994)

	Test for <string.h> vs <strings.h>

	Corrected error in 'match()' that didn't handle properly the case when
	an argument was a null string (i.e., blank lines in a unified diff).

	Added options '-n' and '-V'

	Added patchlev.h, CHANGES files.

	Added install.sh, for autoconf 2.1


Patch 0 (13-Jun-1994)

	Initial release of 'diffstat' (1.12).
